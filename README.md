A generalized Swerve-Drive template repository in Java that's meant to be a drop-in base for future robots.
It includes several features to make development work somewhat easier for the team, and some complex utilities and dependencies for more advanced navigation, odometry, and logging.

## Components
 - AdvantageKit - Advanced logging framework
 - Pathplanner - Comprehensive autonomous
 - PhotonLib - AprilTag/general vision system
 - QuestNav - Odometry data from Quest 3s

More documentation to come.
